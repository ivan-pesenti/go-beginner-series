# go-beginner-series
In this repo you can find the code used for my series about Go.
We're going to build a simple REST API that will make use of some standard concepts like ORM, Dependency Injection and so on.

## Folders
1. In "/src" you can find all of the source code together with the tests
1. In "/docs" there are only files needed to write the blog posts (not consider them)
